# ðŸš€ Welcome to SportsTower!

Project is WIP.

To run the project:

To ensure you're using the correct node version, first run `nvm use` on the project top level.

If you want to change your default to it, you can use: `nvm alias default 6.11.5`

Open a terminal and run `nodemon config.js`
Open another tab and run `webpack --watch`

Keep these two running, nodemon will restart the server on any code changes, and webpack will rebundle bundle.js on code changes. TODO: Find solution where both run at once


Go to localhost:3000
